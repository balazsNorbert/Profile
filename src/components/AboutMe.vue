                I am a <span class="font-bold text-sky-700">highly motivated frontend and full-stack developer</span> with a strong foundation in modern web technologies. My journey into the tech world began during my high school years, where I discovered informatics and later on web development. I have since dedicated myself for building intuitive and efficient web applications. Over the years, I have built my skills through a combination of academic learning, online courses, and hands-on projects. One of the highlights of my experience was last spring, when I had the opportunity to participate in an intensive internship <span class="material-icons md-24 relative top-1">work</span> program. During this time, I worked on a full-stack project utilizing the <span class="font-bold text-sky-700">TALL Stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, and Laravel)</span>, which allowed me to deepen my understanding of both frontend and backend development.

            <p class="text-lg md:text-xl xl:text-2xl animate-fade-in-down">
                I focus on creating <span class="font-bold text-sky-700">responsive and user-friendly applications</span> that not only meet client requirements but also provide an excellent user experience. Web development for me is not just a profession, but also a craft. I am constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and best practices to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact, whether by simplifying complex processes or delivering solutions that bring value to users.

                When I'm not coding, I enjoy pursuing a variety of hobbies that help me stay balanced and inspired. I love working out <span class="material-icons md-24 relative top-1">fitness_center</span> to maintain both physical and mental well-being, watching movies and series, and spending time with friends to recharge. These activities remind me of the importance of a well-rounded life, which I believe is key to sustained growth and success, both personally and professionally.
